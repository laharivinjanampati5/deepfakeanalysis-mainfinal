# Vivitsu - Deepfake Analysis & Defense System

Vivitsu is a comprehensive forensic analysis and defense platform designed to combat deepfakes. It combines multi-modal AI detection, adversarial immunization, and blockchain-based provenance to ensure digital media authenticity.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Forensic Detection Lab
*   **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Utilizes an ensemble of AI models to inspect media:
    *   **Spatial**: EfficientNet analyzes pixel-level artifacts and inconsistencies.
    *   **Temporal**: TimeSformer examines frame-to-frame coherence in videos.
    *   **Biological**: PPG (Photoplethysmography) analysis detects subtle heartbeat signals in human faces.
    *   **Frequency**: Analyzes the Fourier transform spectrum to find generation artifacts.
*   **Explainable AI**: Provides Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize exactly which parts of an image contributed to the deepfake classification.

### 2. Adversarial Immunization
*   **Proactive Defense**: Protects your images *before* they are shared.
*   **FGSM Protection**: Applies Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial noise. This noise is invisible to the human eye but disrupts deepfake generation models (like Stable Diffusion or Midjourney) from successfully modifying your likeness.

### 3. Blockchain Provenance
*   **C2PA Standard**: Implements the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity standards.
*   **Immutable Ledger**: Records the cryptographic signature of original media on a distributed ledger.
*   **Instant Verification**: Allows any third party to verify the origin and edit history of a media file.
